Subject: Makefile: Don't run flake8 when running offlinetest.

Unfortunately, due to the dynamic nature of python, we most certainly would
like to run flake8 when testing the package. Alas, flake8 sometimes
generates style-only warning or "errors" that break the build, in a similar
fashion to what -Werror does to GCC or other compilers.

Therefore, I'm disabling this.
